As a lover of football and FIFA 21, I decided to take part in this data-cleaning challenge, though with little time. The downloaded dataset includes a large dataset of player attributes, club information, and match statistics. This dataset contains information on over 18,000 players from various football clubs around the world. The data is available in raw format, and it requires cleaning and exploring to extract meaningful insights.

The FIFA 21 dataset includes several data tables, including player data, club data, and match data. The player data table includes information on player attributes such as age, height, weight, and overall rating. The club data table includes information on the clubs, including their name, league, and country. The match data table includes information on matches played, including the date, teams, and scores.

After reviewing the dataset, I identified the following issues:

Missing Data: There are missing values in some columns, including player positions, player contract expiry dates, and player release clauses.

Inconsistent Data: Some columns have inconsistent data formats, such as the date format in the match data table.

Duplicate Data: There are some instances of duplicate data in the player data table, where multiple entries exist for the same player.

Outliers: Some columns contain outliers that need further exploration, such as the player's wage and release clause.

To address the issues identified above, I followed these steps:

Missing Data: Missing data were imputed using appropriate methods, such as the mean, median, or mode of the column values. 
Inconsistent Data: I addressed the inconsistent data by standardizing the data format across all columns. For example, the date format in the match data table was standardized to a uniform format.
Duplicate Data: I removed duplicate data by identifying the unique identifiers, such as the player's name, and removing the duplicates.
Outliers: I identified the outliers using statistical methods such as scatter plots, box plots, and histograms. Once identified, I decide whether to remove the outliers or keep them in the dataset based on their significance.

Exploration of the dataset can be done using various techniques, such as descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning algorithms. I explore relationships between variables, identify trends, and extract meaningful insights from the data.

In conclusion, the FIFA 21 dataset is a valuable resource for football enthusiasts and researchers alike. However, it requires cleaning and exploration to extract meaningful insights. The issues identified in this report, such as missing data, inconsistent data, duplicate data, and outliers, were addressed using appropriate methods. The dataset can then be explored using various techniques to extract insights and inform decision-making.

I definitely learned a lot and brushed up my skills in data cleaning with this dataset.

Thanks! :)
